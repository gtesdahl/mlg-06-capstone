# MLG-06 Capstone: Judging a Book by its Cover

As part of the Machine Learning Guild Apprentice Program, my capstone project aims to judge a book by its cover.


## Problem Statement

Although the common adage warns against judging books by their covers, the reality is that many people do. In fact, Publishers Weekly found in a survey of 300 booksellers that 75% felt that the coverâ€™s look and design was the most important element in book promotion. So how can a publisher properly evaluate a given book cover?

## Solution

A CNN classification model that predicts the whether a given book cover will receive a high, medium, or low number of Goodreads ratings. 

## Future Work

- Improve web app
- Generate book covers for certain genres through encoder and decoder networks
- Integrate OCR into the model
- Hook into the CNN to highlight the differentiating aspects of successful book covers
